# Environmental Data Literacy

## ENVS 543: Environmental Data Literacy Fall 2023 {.smaller}

&nbsp;

> Semester course; 3 lecture hours. 3 credits. Enrollment is restricted to students with graduate standing or those with one course in statistics and permission of instructor. Develop quantitative skills for the visualization, manipulation, analysis, and communication of environmental 'big data.' This course focuses on spatial environmental data analysis, data interpretation, manipulation, & analysis of real-world sized data sets, and developing methods and practices that aid in scientific communication using the R statistical analysis environment.

## Philosophy of Backwards Design {background-color="white" background-image="media/backflow.png" background-size="90%" background-position="center"}



## Stage 1: Identify Desired Results 

&nbsp;

1. Determining the overarching learning goals for graduate-level classes
2. Writing clear and measurable learning outcomes
3. Ensuring alignment with program objectives and standards


## Stage 2: Determine Acceptable Evidence

&nbsp;

1. Selecting appropriate assessment methods for graduate-level courses
2. Designing *authentic* assessments that demonstrate mastery of advanced concepts
3. Incorporating formative and summative assessments

## Stage 3: Plan Learning Experiences and Instruction

&nbsp;

1. Designing engaging and meaningful learning experiences for graduate students
2. Identifying instructional strategies that promote deep learning
3. Incorporating technology and resources to enhance instruction

## Stage 4: Implement and Reflect

&nbsp;

1. Collecting and analyzing data to inform instructional decisions
2. Reflecting on the effectiveness of the Backwards Design process
3. Evaluate and promote additive content for the participants

## Student Learning Objectives

> Student Learning Objectives (SLO) are statements that directly specify what participants will know, be able to do, or be able to demonstrate when they have completed or participated in the specific learning activity.

:::{.fragment}
These define the active *verbs* of your learning experiences.  At the end of a course, you should be able to **implement or demonstrate** mastery from each SLO.
:::


## EVS543 Student Learning Objectives {.smaller}

These all map onto [MS/MEnvs Program-Learning Outcomes](https://ces.vcu.edu/academics/graduate-studies/).

- SLO 1: Identity, manipulate, and summarize numerical, categorical, ordinal, logical, date, string, and spatial data types.
- SLO 2: Create habits and took the knowledge to support reproducible research.  
- SLO 3: Create an informative and effective graphical display of various data types of suitable quality for inclusion in published manuscripts.
- SLO 4: Effectively choose appropriate statistical models based on the types of data at hand and the questions being addressed.
- SLO 5: Demonstrate a general understanding of spatial data types and the creation of both appropriate static and dynamic maps.

## Topic Modularity

Each of the topics listed are entirely *self-contained* ([example](https://dyerlab.github.io/ENVS-Lectures/)).  They will each have:

- Student Learning Objectives relevant to the *Topic*
- Preparatory Content & Resources
- In-Person Content & Resources
- Assessment Tools


## Prepatory Content & Resources

These items are intended to provide everyone a background *foundation* understanding of the topic and should be gone through **prior** to class where we are working on this topic.   

 - [Background Readings](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)
 - [Video Lecture](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) 
 - [Slides For Video](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)
 - [Data Sets](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)
 - [Background Assessment Quiz](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)
 - [Longer Background Narrative](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)

## In-Person Content & Resources

This content is intended for in-person activities. In addition to presentation content, these items may include activities for individual work, group project work, reflection activities, and other assessment metrics.  

 - [Slides](slides.html)
 - [In Class](in-class.html)
 - [Additional External Resources](in-class_resources.html)

## Assessment Tools 

The ability of participants to understand, practice, and demonstrate mastery of a topic can be evaluated using both direct and indirect methods.  These will come in a variety of formats.  

- [Homework Assigmnent](homework.html)
- [Topic Reflection](reflection.html)


## Topic Duration

While each self-contained learning module is self-contained and will take as long as it takes to master, there are some limitations to how work is distributed and evaluated in this course.

## Grading Policy

The grade for this course is based upon the totality of the points gained for all assignments as well as a single large data analysis project that will be due at the end of the semester.  Grades will be determined using the normal 10% scale:  

- A (>= 90%),  
- B (>= 80% & < 90%),   
- C (>= 70% & < 80%),  
- D (>= 60% & < 70%), and   
- F (< 60%).
